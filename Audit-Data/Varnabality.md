Reentrancy attack in releaseEscrowFunds allows funds to be drained
**Description**
The function releaseEscrowFunds() calls safeTransfer() before updating state variables, which can allow a malicious contract to repeatedly call the function and drain funds.

**Impact**
 High - Funds can be stolen through reentrancy.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
 Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and implement ReentrancyGuard.

 Missing access control in addBusinessToDehix() allows unauthorized business creation
**Description**
 The function addBusinessToDehix() does not enforce any access control, allowing any user to create or overwrite business records.

**Impact**
High - Unauthorized businesses can be registered, leading to potential fraud.

**Proof of Concepts**


**Recommended mitigation**
 Implement an onlyOwner or onlyAuthorized modifier.

### [M-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
Business ID overwrite in addBusinessToDehix()

**Description**
 The function allows overwriting existing business records without validation.

**Impact**
 Medium - Legitimate business data can be tampered with.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
 Require that a business ID does not already exist before adding.

### [M-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
Duplicate applications in applyToProjectToDehix()

**Description**
 The function allows a freelancer to apply multiple times to the same project.

**Impact**
 Medium - Can result in inflated application numbers and incorrect logic execution.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
 Check if _freelancerId is already in appliedFreelancers before updating.




### [M-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
 Inefficient oracle voting logic
**Description**
 The _majorityVote() function iterates through the Orecles array multiple times.

**Impact**
 Medium - Increased gas costs for every vote.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
Store Orecles.length in memory for optimized iteration.




### [S-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
`public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`
**Description**
The functions `getProject`, `getFreelancer`, `getFreelancerByAddress` are not used internally and could be marked `external` to reduce gas costs.

**Impact**
Low - Minor optimization opportunity.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
Mark the unused functions as `external` to reduce gas costs.






### [S-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function
**Description**
The modifiers `onlyOwner` and `onlyFreelancer` are invoked only once in the contract

**Impact**
Low - Minor optimization opportunity.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
The modifiers can be moved inside the functions they are invoked in to reduce gas costs.






### [S-#] TITLE (Root + Impact)
Potentially unused `private` / `internal` state variables found.

**Description**
The following state variables are declared as `private` or `internal` but are not used in the contract:

**Impact**
Low - Minor optimization opportunity.

**Proof of Concepts**

**Recommended mitigation**
Remove unused state variables to reduce gas costs.
